###The following image displays the data in its initial state, before any cleaning or processing was done.

This image shows how names in both columns were merged. It was merged by using the “merge” function to join both names by using a separator “space” to create a new column titled “full name”.

The images above showcase the process of cleaning and formatting dates. As we can see from the data, the dates are not in the same format. To work effectively with the data, we need to first put them in the same format. To achieve this, we'll use a common separator, in this case, a hyphen (-), to make the date uniform across all entries.
 Next, we'll split the column by a delimiter (-) to separate the days, months, and years in new columns. This will make it easier to work with the dates. 
Finally, we'll merge the columns with a separator (-) and give the column a new name, "Date of Birth". It's important to ensure that all column names are well-written and that the data is in the correct format.

By following these steps, we can effectively clean and format our data, making it easier to work and analyze.
